## Data Types
### Undiracted Graphs
- DFS: Go Deep down use recursion/stack to check adj node(s). 
- BFS: Queue each node and check the adj. Use df {edge (index), edgeTo[] (int), disTo[] (int)}
- CC (connected components): Each cluster into 1 category. Each node in category is connected.

### Directed Graph
- Strong Component: digraph that have in and out. Similar to CC.
